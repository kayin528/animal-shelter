<h1>Welcome to Didier's Animal Shelter</h1>

 <p> We have a <span class="header">wide selection</span> of cuddly, <span class="header">adorable puppies</span> available for adoption.</p>

 	<li><strong>Tickles, the formidable boxer</strong></li>
        <img src="img/boxer.jpg" class="image"alt="boxer">
 		<p> Meet Tickles. With paws that look like they’ve been dipped in white chocolate and eyes the color of Hershey’s kisses, <span class="accent">Allie</span> looks like a candy bar covered in fur! This sweeter-than-sugar gal is a 7-year old, 45-pound Boxer who is pretty, perky, and packed with personality!</p>
 		<p>Allie is always in a good mood and has a constantly <span class="accent">wagging tail.</span> She is super friendly and adores the company of humans. She is wiggly and warm-hearted, and gives the <u>absolute</u> best greetings when you return home from work or wherever...as if you’ve been gone for a year!</p>

    <div class="column-left">
 	  <li><strong>Pebbles, the ravishing Bulldog</strong></li>
 	      <img src="img/french-bulldog.jpg" class="image"alt="bulldog">
 	      <p>Nutty...but in a good way! That’s Walnut, for ya! This 10-month old, 35-pound, tan-coated, <span class="accent">bulldog</span> is silly, playful, energetic, charming and handsome...and is seeking a love that’s pure and true.</p>
          <p>An ideal day for Walnut would include a visit to the dog park, lots of treats, plenty of <span class="accent">cuddles</span>, a nice long stroll through the ‘hood, a chicken-n-kibble dinner with a side of fresh water ;-), and a <u>belly rub</u> right before bedtime. It doesn’t take much to make this bubbly boy beam!</p>

      <div class="column-right">
        <li><strong>Lucky, the hunting labrador</strong></li>

            <p>Let me introduce you to Gracie, and what a stunning pooch she is! Boasting a dark ebony coat, with <span class="accent">beautiful</span> be-speckled paws, and the deepest brown eyes you’ve ever seen, this girl is simply gorgeous! </p>
			<p>During her time at Bideawee, Gracie has already won over the staff and volunteers with her <u>sweet</u> personality!This sweet girl is definitely shy at first, but once she knows you, her <span class="accent">sparkling</span> personality shines bright! </p>
			<p>Gracie is an active girl, who would love a family that would enjoy spending time taking her on long walks, and <u>exploring</u> different places? </p>
